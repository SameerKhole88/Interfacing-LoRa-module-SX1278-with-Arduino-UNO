# Interfacing-LoRa-module-SX1278-with-Arduino-UNO
This repository consists of Interfacing LoRa module Sx-1278 with Arduino UNO. 
This repository also contains Source code for both transmitter and Receiver circuits with diagram.
This project contains a Proteus Software project file which shows only interfacing circuit diagram for LoRa with Arduino UNO.
Note: Proteus file is just a Schematic diagram, project does not runs on it.
Source code 1: LoRa-Tx file contains source code for Transmitter section of Arduino UNO & LoRa module SX-1278.
Source code 2: LoRa-Rx file contains source code for Receiver section of Arduino UNO & LoRa module SX-1278.
In this project, I have sent a packet/ message/ string of "Hello" which is successfully received by the receiver LoRa module and output is observed on Serial Monitor of Arduino Software.
